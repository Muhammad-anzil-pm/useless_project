### Project Description
Our calculator does the simple math to find the perfect angles for your samosa fold.
This helps you create a strong, leak-proof triangle that holds its shape perfectly during frying.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The Sad Samosa Spill 

You know that frustrating moment. You've carefully folded your samosas, but the second they hit the hot oil, one of them bursts open. All that delicious filling you worked so hard on spills out, leaving you with a sad, greasy, and empty piece of dough.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A simple calculator that gives you the right angle for your samosa fold.

It helps you make a strong little pocket that keeps all the yummy filling safely inside. Is it a bit nerdy? Yes. But does it give you a perfect, non-leaking samosa every time? Also yes

## Technical Details
### Technologies
For Software:
HTML5: The standard language used to create the structure and content of your web page.

CSS3: The language used for all the visual styling, including the colors, layout, and the custom loader animation.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that you used for rapid and responsive design directly in your HTML.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): The programming language that powers all the interactivity, from handling the file upload to calculating the random angles and updating the display.

Google Fonts: An external service you used to embed the custom 'Inter' and 'Kalam' fonts to give your app a unique look.



### Implementation
The Samosa Angle Calculator is a fully client-side application built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Its implementation is designed to create a humorous user experience by simulating a complex analysis that is, in reality, a simple and clever trick. The process is broken down into the following key steps:


# Installation
1. clone the repository:
```bash

 ```

### Project Documentation
### The Samosa Conspiracy
#### 1. Project Overview
The Samosa Conspiracy is a humorous, single-page web application designed to entertain users. It presents itself as a sophisticated tool that uses "AI" to calculate the geometric angles of a samosa from an uploaded image.
The core of the project is a joke: the application does not perform any image analysis. Instead, it simulates a processing delay and then displays a set of randomly generated, but mathematically valid, angles for a triangle. The project's goal is to provide a fun, sharable experience that plays on the idea of over-engineering a solution for a non-existent problem.

#### 2. Core Features
Simulated Image Analysis: The app mimics the user flow of an AI tool, including an upload button, a loading animation, and a results display.
Dynamic UI: The interface cleanly transitions between states (upload, loading, results, error) to provide clear user feedback.
Random Angle Generation: A clever algorithm generates a set of three angles that always add up to 180¬∞, ensuring the "results" are believable.
Humorous Content: The project is filled with personality, from its title and loading messages to its witty error screens (e.g., "‡¥™‡¥±‡µç‡¥±‡¥ø‡¥ö‡µç‡¥ö‡µá!").
Responsive Design: The user interface is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

#### 3. Technologies Used
HTML5: Used for the fundamental structure and content of the web page.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for the majority of the styling, layout, and responsiveness.
CSS3: Used for specific custom features like the gradient background, the "glassmorphism" card effect, and the animated loader.
JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Powers all the interactive logic, including handling file uploads, managing the UI state, and running the "fake" calculation.
Google Fonts: Used to embed the custom 'Inter' and 'Kalam' fonts to create a unique and playful typographic style.

#### 4. Implementation Details
The application operates entirely on the client-side in the user's browser. The workflow is as follows:
User Upload: The user selects an image file. An event listener triggers the handleImageUpload function.
File Reading & UI Update: The FileReader API reads the image file. Simultaneously, the UI hides the upload section and displays a loading animation to simulate processing.
The "Fake" Delay: The application intentionally waits for 2 seconds using setTimeout. The image data itself is never used.
Angle Calculation: A function generates two random angles and calculates the third to ensure their sum is 180¬∞. A loop prevents any single angle from being unrealistically small.
Display Results: The UI updates to hide the loader and show the three randomly generated angles, completing the illusion.
Reset: The user can click a button to reset the interface to its initial state.

#### 5. Potential Future Enhancements
Funny Verdict: Display a humorous "expert rating" or verdict for the samosa after showing the angles (e.g., "Structurally sound. Certified for deep frying.").
Image Preview: Show a thumbnail of the user's uploaded image on the results screen to make the joke more convincing.
Share Button: Add a button that copies a pre-written, funny message to the clipboard so users can easily share their "analysis" on social media.
